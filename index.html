Here's the agenda for this talk.

We will assume you have a working knowledge of java, and are interested in Scala but not sure how to start.
We will presents lessons we learned, so you could hit new problems. Many of the features we touch will not be covered to their full depth - we aim for a broad view of Scala, not a fully detailed one.

---

# Why Scala

* Implement a project based on a template that's relatively close to the final project
  * Such as Akka distributed worker template
* Create a web application using Play!
  - has a Java flavor as well, but template engine uses Scala only
* Try some functional programming
  - Scala may not be your best choice
* Try some _postfunctional_ programming
>  If you look at the features Scala provides, it is substantially a functional language, but... it does not force you to adopt the functional style. I think .emph[postfunctional] is a good term for that blend.
.right[Martin Odersky, http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/4960]
* Everyone's favorite reasons:
  * Learn a new and interesting language
  * Bend your mind in new ways.
  * Just because

# Colliding Concepts

While sharing the JVM, and Java's extensive libraries, Scala and Java are very different languages. Some words have different meanings. 

Intuitions created by years of working with Java can be misleading. You may end up doing as much _unlearning_ as you do _learning_.

It's a good thing, if you're ready for it.

.arrow[So We've gathered a few examples.]

???

Right. So you decided to actually start using scala (took me about 8 years, long story). Here are the confusing parts coming from Java.

  Colliding<br />Concepts

---
name: syntax
#Syntax
### Semicolon inference
Semi-colons are optional at the end of a line containing an expression
* Two expressions, two lines
  ```scala
    print("hello, ")
    println("world!")
  ```

* Two expressions, one line
  ```scala
    print("hello, "); println("world!")
  ```
* One expression, multiple lines:
  a line ending is treated as a semicolon unless:
  1. End in a word that would not be legal at the end of a expression
  2. Next line begins with a word that cannot start a expression
  3. Line ends while inside parentheses or bracket

---

#Syntax

### []s, ()s and {}s
`[]` are for type parameters, `&lt;&gt;` are for XML literals and operators, `()` and `{}` are interchangeable.

.right[&rarr; Array access is done using `array(index)`, not `array[index]`!]

???
.emph[Array access]: This makes more sense, as arrays are really a function from indices to items. Recall that the `[]` operator was created for C's type of arrays, and the pointer arithmetic the used.

---

# Syntax
### Type name goes after the variable name
.column.column-right[
Scala:
```scala
  myString: String
```]
.column.column-left[
Java:
```java
String myString;
```
]
.column-clear.right[
Personal goal: stop getting confused as early as Q3 of 2041.
]

However, declaring a value's type is not always necessary - 
.emph[in many cases Scala can infer types on its own:]
```scala
val myString = "Hello!" //myString is a String
```

---
name: constructors
# Constructors, Reconstructed

Unlike Java, .emph[each class has a single primary constructor], whose definition dovetails the class' definition:
<pre><code class="scala hljs remark-code">class Bof( <span style="color:#88F">var title:String</span>,
           <span style="color:#880">val num:Int</span>,
           <span style="color:#F88">topic: String</span> ) {
  def desc = title + ", a BOF about " + topic
}
</code></pre>
* `var v:T` becomes a mutable field of the class
* `val v:T` becomes a final field of the class
* `v:T` is a value that can be used inside the class
* The body of the primary constructor is all the code directly within the class.

Alternative description (Odersky):
> Classes have parameters, just like methods do.

---
# Auxiliary Constructors 
It is also possible to define .emph[auxiliary constructors].

Auxiliary Constructors:
* Are called `this(...)`
* Have to begin by calling the primary constructor, or another auxiliary constructor.
  - Either way, that constructor is referred to as `this`.

```scala
class Bof( var title:String,
           val num:Int,
           topic: String ) {
  def desc = title + ", a BOF about " + topic

*  def this( title:String ) = {
*    this( title, title.size, "the topic of '%s'".format(title))
*  }
}
```

---
# Method invocation

* Methods that take no parameters may be invoked by just calling them - no need for `()` after the name.
```scala
  scala> def f()={ println("hello") }
  f: ()Unit
  scala> f // prints "hello"
  scala> f() // prints "hello"
  scala> f _
  res9: () => Unit = <function0>
```
* Single parameter methods can be invoked using an alternative to the dot-notation:<br />
  `a + b` is the same as `a.+(b)`
* Right associative methods: When last character of method name is `:` <br />
  `a +: b` is the same as `b.+:(a)`
* The `apply()` method - creates a "default" method for objects - no need to type the `apply` part.<br />
  `instance()` is really `instance.apply` which is really `instance.apply()`
```scala
scala> (f _)() // prints "hello"
```
???

* No-parameter functions may be invoked with no parens. 
* Reference the function itself via `f _`
* This allows better abstractions than getters, as the client code can't tell if they're calling a function or accessing a parameter.

---
# The Point of No `return`

All methods return values. .emph[Thus, the `return` keyword is often superfluous].

In the absence of an explicit return keyword, a method will return the last value computed.

`return` is useful as a type of `break` that returns a value.

These samples are functionally the same:

```scala
class SumWithInt {
  var sum = 0
  def add(b: Int):Int={
    sum += b
    return sum
  }
  def add1( i:Int )={
    sum += i
    sum
  }
}
```
.bottom-remark[Code: Returns.scala at presentation repo]

---
# `Unit` filling the `void`

All methods return values.
.emph[Thus, declaring a method to be of a `void` type is impossible.]

Method that has nothing to return, can return `Unit`, a type with a single value, marked as `()`. This allows everything to be an .emph[expression] - Scala has no statements.

These samples are functionally the same:

```scala
class SumWithUnit {
  var sum = 0
  def add(b: Int): Unit ={
     sum += b
     return ()
  }
  def add1( i:Int ) {
    sum += i
    ()
  }
  def add2( i:Int ) = {
    sum += i
  }
  def add3( i:Int ) = sum += i
}
```
.bottom-remark[Code: Returns.scala at presentation repo]
???

Go from verbose to succinct. Note that `+=` yields `()` so `add2` and `add3` work.

Ways of returning unit:
* No `=`
* Explicitly
* Declare method to be of type unit

Unit is a type that only has a single value, `()`. Thus, there's no point looking into what that value is (unlike instances of `Int`). 
* Q: So what's the difference from return type `void`?
  * A: Returning a Unit makes it an expression rather than a statement. There are no statements in Scala - everything returns a value. That's FP.
* Q (if time): What should be the return type of `System.exit`?
  * A: `void`, probably, it does not return.

BTW, another casualty of the "everything is statement" is the trenary operator - no need for it, as `if` is an expression that returns a value

---
# `class` vs. `object`

Using the `object` keyword, programs can declare and construct an instance at design time. This is different from the `class` keyword, where instance construction is done at runtime, using the `new` keyword.

```scala
object Counter {
  var count = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger(0)
  def up() = count.addAndGet(1)
  def down() = count.addAndGet(-1)
  def value = count.get
}
```
```sh
scala> Counter.up
res5: Int = 1
```
* The created object is a singleton, initialized the first time its called.
* Objects can extend classes, and traits, as usual.
* The object's type is implicitly defined, but can be accessed (e.g. when creating DSLs).

---
# Companion Objects replace `static`

There is no `static` class members in Scala. Functionality that belongs to a class (rather than to its instances) goes in that class' .emph[Companion Object]. 


```scala
class Burrito private( val filling:String ) { ... }

object Burrito {
  var count = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger(0)
  def makeWith( filling:String ) = {
    count.incrementAndGet()
    new Burrito(filling)
  }
  def brag() = "%,d burritos served".format(count.get)
}
```
```sh
scala> Burrito makeWith "beans"
res22: Burrito = Burrito with beans
...
scala> Burrito.brag
res14: String = 6 burritos served
```

???
* Companion objects have to be defined with the class, in the same file.
* More flexible than `static`, as they can extend other classes.


---
# `apply()` is the new `new`

Define an `apply` method on a companion object, and you can skip `new`:

```scala
object Burrito {
  var count = new java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger(0)
  def makeWith( filling:String ) = {
    count.incrementAndGet()
    new Burrito(filling)
  }
* def apply( filling:String ) = makeWith(filling)
  ///...
}
```
```sh
scala> Burrito("Everything")
res28: Burrito = Burrito with Everything
```

---
# Starting an Application
No `static` &rarr; No `public static void main`.

Objects that extend the `Application` trait serve as application starting points.

```scala
object MyApplication extends Application {
 def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    // ...
  }
}
```

# What Do Mean By `List`?

Ordered collection of elements.

# Collection Library

immutable vs mutable, same name different package

# New Concepts

Scala introduces many concepts that are not present in Java. Often, when you look at Scala code, it's unclear where values come from, how can objects extends so many classes, and so on.

This confused us too.

# `val` vs. `var`

* val - immutable value
* var - mutable value

* immutability bias
```scala
  val workerId = UUID.randomUUID().toString
  var currentWorkId: Option[String] = None
```

---
#Traits vs interfaces

Traits define signatures of supported methods, like Java interfaces, but can also provide
default interfaces. 

Mixin-  extends keyword
```scala
trait Startup {

  def startBackend(joinAddressOption: Option[Address], role: String): Address = {
//...
    joinAddress
  }
```  
```scala

object Main extends Startup {
// ...
}


```  
```scala
class Master(workTimeout: FiniteDuration) extends Actor with ActorLogging {

```
---
#Tuples

```scala
( 3, "Boston",199.5)
//Tuple3(Int, java.lang.String, Double)
rank=t._1,word=t._2 Score=t._3
```
 
 Simple way to return multiple values from a method, where semantic meaning is not 
 important enough to pre-define a class to return the values
Don't overuse, remember objects are really annotated tuples (what's the semantics of the `String` value at `t._2`?)

* Tuple22 is largest size
* 1-based index as in Haskell

---
# case classes
Pattern matching

```scala
object MasterWorkerProtocol {
  // Messages from Workers
  case class RegisterWorker(workerId: String)
  case class WorkerRequestsWork(workerId: String)
  case class WorkIsDone(workerId: String, workId: String, result: Any)
  case class WorkFailed(workerId: String, workId: String)

  // Messages to Workers
  case object WorkIsReady
  case class Ack(id: String)
}
```

automatic on declaration:
constructor parameters are vals unless explicitly declared var (no setters)
apply method is provided
unapply method is provided
toString, equals, hashcode and copy are generated unless explicitly provided

---

#case classes

```scala

  def receive = {
    case RegisterWorker(workerId) =>
      if (workers.contains(workerId)) {
        workers += (workerId -> workers(workerId).copy(ref = sender))
      } else {
        log.debug("Worker registered: {}", workerId)
        workers += (workerId -> WorkerState(sender, status = Idle))
        if (pendingWork.nonEmpty)
          sender ! WorkIsReady
      }
    case WorkerRequestsWork(workerId) =>
      if (pendingWork.nonEmpty) {
        workers.get(workerId) match {
// ...
            sender ! work
        }
      }
    case WorkIsDone(workerId, workId, result) =>
      workers.get(workerId) match {
// ... 
          sender ! MasterWorkerProtocol.Ack(workId)
      }

# Don't Believe Everything You Hear About FP

Functional programming is great for some things, and not-so-great for others. It is somewhat hyped at the moment.

Scala, a .emph[postfunctional] language, allows you to choose the approach you deem best, or just feel like trying. Don't be confused by the internets.

* Mutability is OK, as long as there's no concurrent updates
  * `java.util.concurrent` is still there for you
  * Object creation and clean-up may be cheap, but it's not free!
  * Side-effects are hard to reason about formally. This is why we still have jobs.
* Tail recursion is not the best thing since sliced bread
  * It's a way to coerce an recursive algorithm into a shape that will allow the compiler to further coerce it into a loop.
  * Makes total sense in Lisp, ML etc. where there are no loops.
  * You're writing in Scala. You can actually use a loop.
    * When you do use a tail recursion, don't forget `@tailrec`.

# Ease Into Functional Programming

At your leisure, consider re-writing existing, "Scala-with-Java-accent" code using functional programming idioms.


### Case study: Re-writing in Scala
**Problem:** Create a poor-man's Markdown to HTML conversion, supporting `<p>`s and single level `<ul>`s.

**Input:** Sequence of `String`s in markdown syntax
  > Lines starting with `*` should become `<li>`s, grouped and nested in a `<ul>` element.

**Output:** Sequence of `<p>` and `<ul>` elements, according to Markdown rules.

Even more functional:

```scala
def html3( rawStrings : Seq[String] ) = {
  val elements = rawStrings.map( _.trim )
                   .map( s => if (s.startsWith("*"))
                                {"<li>"+s.substring(1).trim+"</li>"}
                              else
                                {"<p>" + s + "</p>"} )

  val grouped = elements.tail.foldLeft( List(List(elements.head)) )(
                   (l,s) => { 
                      if ( l.last.head(1) != s(1) ) 
                          l :+ List(s)
                      else
                          l.dropRight(1) :+ (l.last :+ s)})

  grouped.flatMap( l => if (l.head.startsWith("<li>")) 
                          List("<ul>"+l.mkString+"</ul>")
                        else
                           l ).mkString
}
```
Using `foldLeft`, we create a list of lists of `String`s, and operate on them. Then, use `flatMap` to convert the result to a list of strings, and then use `mkString` to create the final string.


.bottom-remark[Actual code included in presentation repo at GitHub.]

???
* Code looks better when not confined to a slide
* Fold takes a `sequence[type]` and returns an instance of that type. In order to end up with a sequence, we need to operate on a sequence of sequences.
* Is this more readable? More performant? More intuitive?
  - Dunno, but it was a fun experience and I'm happy I did it.
